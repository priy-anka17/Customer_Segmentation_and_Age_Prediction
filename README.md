The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and the development of an age prediction model. The dataset used contains customer information from a mall, including age, gender, annual income, and spending score. Key project steps include data visualization, model building (Linear Regression and Random Forest), feature importance analysis, and model deployment considerations. The project provides valuable insights into customer behavior and enables more effective marketing strategies.
